## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I didn't really do a mobile first approach - which perhaps was a mistake.

It took some restructuring to get it to work in both mobile and desktop.

### Continued development

I will try to keep mobile in mind in the future, before going headfirst into the solution.
